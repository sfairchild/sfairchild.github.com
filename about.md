I am a Ruby developer who loves building cool things. Part of that includes constantly learning new things that can help me build even bigger, more ambitious projects.

Outside of work, I enjoy hardware hacking particularly working on learning everything I can about Arduino. I have also been playing with my 3d printer and I love seeing the code I write turn into physical things.

I am a novice VIM'er, I would love to get to the point where it becomes my primary text editor everyday.

If any of these seem of interest to you, feel free to reach out and connect.
