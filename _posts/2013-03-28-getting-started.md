I often have little choice but to use Windows to develop Ruby. If possible, spend the extra $$ to get yourself a mac, most ruby developer's use mac for development so you will find ton's of support, or you can try to install a Linux distribution, I like [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/ "Ubuntu") and [Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/ "Linux Mint"), on you machine. If you don't want to give up windows, you could setup a dual boot.

### Your Options

In the past few years, ruby has gotten easier to install on Windows due to the hard work of a few people. There are 2 great packages to us to almost instantly install ruby for you.

My choice is [Rails Installer][rails]. It includes a few great extras to help you get started fast including

* Rails (most ruby work includes rails work)
* Bundler
* Git
* Database tools
* DevKit

It was created and maintained by the guy over at [Engine Yard][engin]. As of this writing, it's at ruby version 1.9.3 .

The other option in the [Ruby Installer][ruby]. It is current at version 2.0.0. But it is a little more work to get it installed as the DevKit (a tool to allow you to run some C-based tools) is a separate package.

I will be showing you how to install both of these packages to get the best of both worlds.

### Installing Ruby

Its time to get our hands dirty and start installing ruby.

First we are going to use the [Rails Installer][rails] to get our first ruby instance setup, I'm not going to repeat an extremely easy instructions that they already produced, is just follow the link and follow the step-by-step instructions.
