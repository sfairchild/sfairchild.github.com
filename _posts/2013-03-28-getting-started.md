I often have little choice but to use Windows to develop Ruby. If possible, spend the extra $$ to get yourself a mac, most ruby developer's use mac for development so you will find ton's of support, or you can try to install a Linux distribution, I like [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/ "Ubuntu") and [Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/ "Linux Mint"), on you machine. If you don't want to give up windows, you could setup a dual boot.



### Installing Ruby

In the past few years, ruby has gotten easier to install on Windows due to the hard work of a few people.
